# Introduction

- Many factors are involved in the configuration of a music genre, such as style, historical context, and harmonic structures (`r Citet(bibs[key = "Caldas2010"])`)

- Defining music genres is not a trivial task, and is
an important problem in various aspects of music studies 


>  The focus of this work is towards **verifying the connection between harmonic information and genre specification in Brazilian music**, through the evaluation of feature importance in machine learning models

- Mid-level music features such as chords configure a rich resource of information regarding genres
(`r Citet(bibs[key = "Cheng2008"])`, 
`r Citet(bibs[key = "Correa2016"])`)

- We use symbolic chords data and manually extracted harmonic features for genre classification

  - **The features represent the chords structures in different and meaningful ways**

class: inverse, middle, center

### .fancy[Definitions]

## Data

> Type: **Symbolic chords sequences for each song**

<br>

- The chords are extracted from the Cifraclub, 
an online collaborative page of music-sharing, through
the `chorrrds` (`r Citet(bibs[key = "chorrrds"])`)
package for `R` (`r Citet(bibs[key = "Rsoftware"])`)

  -  Crowd-sourced data is becoming more common in the literature  (e.g. `r Citet(bibs[key = "odekerken2020decibel"])`)
  

- In total, **8 music genres** were used: Reggae, Pop, Forró, Bossa Nova, Sertanejo, MPB, Rock, and Samba

- **106 different artists** were available on the online platform, for which the chords and keys for **8339 songs** were collected

---

## Manually Extracted Features

- Interpretable summary features from the chords, to make them
more informative

.pull-left[

**First set, triads and simple tetrads:**
- percentage of suspended chords (e.g. Gsus), 
- of chords with the seventh (e.g. C7), 
- of minor chords with the seventh (e.g. Em7, C#m7), 
- of minor (e.g. Em, C#m), 
- of diminished (e.g. Bdim)
- and of augmented (e.g. Baug) chords

**Second set, Tetrads:** 
- percentage of chords with the fourth (e.g. D4), 
- the sixth (e.g. E6), 
- the ninth (e.g. G9), 
- with the major seventh (e.g. F7+, Am7+), 
- with a diminished fifth (e.g. C5- or C5b) 
- and with an augmented fifth (e.g. C5+ or C5#)
]

knitr::include_graphics("img/feat_example.png")
```
]


---

## Manually Extracted Features

**Third set, main chord transitions:**
- percentage of the first, second, and third most common chord transitions in the song

**Fourth set, miscellany:**
- popularity, 
- total of non-distinct chords, 
- year of album release, 
- indicator of the key of the song being the same as the most common chord, 
- percentage of chords with varying bass (e.g. C/E, C/G, C/Bb), 
- mean distance of the root note to ’C’ in the circle of fifths, 
- mean distance of the root note to ’C’ in semitones, 
- absolute number of the most common chord

<br>

> Supplementary features about the release year and popularity were obtained with the help of the well-known **Spotify API**

---

## Machine Learning Algorithm

> Popular Random Forest (`r Citet(bibs[key = "Breiman2001"])`) model

-  Characterized by being a tree ensemble
that only allows
a random subset $m$ of the features to be the candidates for a split, helping to create uncorrelated trees

- The model equation can be written as 
$$\hat f(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{n = 1}^{N_{\text{tree}}} \frac{1}{N_{\text{tree}}} \hat f_n(\mathbf{x}),$$

where $\hat f_n$ corresponds to the $n$-th estimated tree, out
of a total of $N_{\text{tree}}$ trees, and $\mathbf{x}$ is the
feature set 

> **Advantage**: We can easily access the importance (misclassification
reduction) for each feature used in the model

### .fancy[Results]

# Results

- Four models were created in a nested fashion, with each new model being added with one of the features sets 

- Table 1 shows that, for all different models, there is evidence of their accuracy being significantly higher the non-information classification rate
  - The addition of the feature sets progressively increases the accuracy of the models
  - This shows how the 4 set of features are informative in predicting the music genres

```{r,  results='asis'}
library(kableExtra)
library(formattable)
library(huxtable)

tab <- data.frame(
  Model = paste0("Model ", 1:4), 
  Accuracy = c(0.53, 0.57, 0.59, 0.62), 
  L.B. = c(0.51, 0.54, 0.56, 0.6), 
  U.B. = c(0.55, 0.59, 0.6, 0.64), 
  Kappa = c(0.37, 0.42, 0.44, 0.49), 
  P.Value = rep("<0.0001", 4))

- From Table 2, we can see that there is considerable
confusion between MPB and Bossa Nova, highlighting their 
known harmonic similarities
- The same happens to Forró, Sertanejo
and Pop, which are music genres with a similar origin and,
in general, more elementary harmonic structures

- Figure 1 shows that the first set of features is the most informative one
  - With the basic chords information we can already obtain good results in terms of informing the model about the genres
  
- The external features (year and popularity),
got a high rank in the plot, showing how the Spotify data is also pertinent

- The position of the transitions and distances features strengthens the idea of harmonic characteristics being very important to discriminate between music genres

### .fancy[Conclusions]

# Conclusions

- Manually engineered harmonic features can be useful to characterize Brazilian music genres

- The **most discriminative** features are:
  - the percentage of chords with the seventh note, 
  - of minor chords with the seventh note, 
  - of minor chords,
  - the year of release of the songs, 
  - the popularity 
  - and the behavior of the most common chord transitions
  
- Our insights can be extended to other music genres that influenced or were influenced by the genres considered here, such as Jazz, Pop, and Rock music

- Next steps of this work include the engineering of the new variables and applying different machine learning algorithms, as well as exploring more the use of chords crowdsourced data
